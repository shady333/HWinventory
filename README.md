# Hot Wheels Inventory Tracker üöó

## About the Project
Hot Wheels Inventory Tracker is an **amateur project** created to make life easier for Hot Wheels collectors. This tool automatically tracks inventory for Hot Wheels releases, including Mattel Creations, Red Line Club (RLC), and other exclusive series in the US and UK. It provides real-time stock updates, helping collectors stay informed about availability.

The project includes:
- A daily-updated inventory page: [Hot Wheels Inventory](https://neverold2play.blogspot.com/p/hot-wheels-inventory.html)
- Social media links to stay connected with the community.
- 3D models inspired by Hot Wheels, available on Cults3D.

This is a non-commercial project built for the love of Hot Wheels collecting! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: Inventory updates every 2 hours and at 16:00 UTC.
- **US and UK Support**: Tracks inventory for both regions.
- **Social Sharing**: Share the inventory page on X, Facebook, or copy the link.
- **Hot Wheels-Themed 3D Models**: Check out custom 3D-printed accessories on Cults3D.

## How It Works
1. A Python script (`script.py`) scrapes inventory data from official Hot Wheels websites.
2. Data is saved in `inventory.json` and updated via GitHub Actions.
3. The inventory is displayed on a Blogger page with tables for easy viewing.
